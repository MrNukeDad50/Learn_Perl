## Lesson 00: Setup - Done
The purpose of this is to prepare for working through the Begining Perl online book
I want to setup a GitHub repsitory and make sure i can do the basic changes 
on the main branch, then make a new branch.
I also want to do this on two platforms so i can get used to using it
in multiple locations and manage the code.
Lastly, I want to establish a template for 
working through the Beginning Perl Lessons.
1. Create a GitHub Repository called "BeginningPerl" - done
2. Using the Mac Terminal:
    - Clone "BeginningPerl" repository
    - Update README.md to include Lesson 0 using nano
    - Add, commit, and push the updated README to GitHub
    - This is now complete
3. Now update the same repository using Visual Studio Code
    - Updated and commit the changes again to GitHub
    - This is now complete
4. Repeat the clone on my linux box and upload the template for lesson 1. on Ubuntu
    - This is now complete
5. Revert the last commit
    - This is now complete
6. Update other repository on local Mac
    - This is now complete
